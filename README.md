# React Portfolio

## Description
The following application is a portfolio built with React. It includes four sections: "About", "Portfolio", "Contact" and "Resume". The about me section contains my Github profile picture and a short paragraph of some general information about me. The Portfolio section includes 6 projects that I have built and deployed via Github. The Contact section includes three input boxes that asks the user to enter their name, email, and message respectively. Note that this section does not have a functional backend yet. Lastly, the resume section includes some frontend and back-end software that I have some experience in.
