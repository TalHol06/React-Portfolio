        Hi! My name is Ta'Lee Hollins-Bailey and this is my React portfolio. I am a upcoming Web Developer from Tennessee. Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming and reading. I currently have experience coding in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Node, and some SQL and express. Some projects i've built include a Book journal site called BookKeeper, a README Generator, Vehicle Builder, and a couple others that you can view on the portfolio tab. If you have any further questions feel free to reach out to me in the contact tab.
